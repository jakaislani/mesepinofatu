Normally, it takes no more than 1-2 days (once pins form at least, and that can take UP TO 1-2 weeks after mycelium has fully colonised the substrate). Some mushrooms do need that much time. The maturation of the fruit of Psilocybe cyanescens may take an extremely long period.
And how long does it take to get Shroomery pins after ordering them? After you have placed it under fruiting circumstances, you should begin to see pins after 7-10 days of doing so.</description></item><item><title>If nothing else, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania allowed the Marvel Universe to experience T</title><link>/if-nothing-else-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-allowed-the-marvel-universe-to-experience-thanos-snap-in-real-life.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/if-nothing-else-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-allowed-the-marvel-universe-to-experience-thanos-snap-in-real-life.html</guid><description>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is finally on Disney Plus and while Marvel is surely busy ruing the day it decided to make the film in the first place, the studio should at least acknowledge the fact that the sequel has given the MCU a chance to experience its biggest event ever in real life — Thanos’ universe-annihilating Snap.&amp;nbsp;
